# SteamMarketCandlestick
This repository uses Github Actions to retrieve data for a specific item from the Steam Market API. The script plots the data in a candle chart for easier visualization of the item's price fluctuations over time. The chart is updated every 5 minutes and added to the README.md file so that you can easily see the price evolution.

currently the script is focused only on the AK-47 Slate (Field-Tested), but I am working on a way to retrieve data for multiple items at once.
